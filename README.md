# NFTMailChimpForWeb3

This project aims to develop a Mailchimp alternative for Web3 using Compressed NFTs. The goal is to end reliance on Mailchimp (a centralized entity) with a web3-ish method of communicating with users (creators). We utilize cNFTs and duster as a way to send mass communication with creators/users.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- Underdog Protocol API
- Dispatch API (for messaging interface)
- Synap API

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/juniorvish/NFTMailChimpForWeb3.git
   ```
2. Install the required APIs

## Usage

The application allows you to create lists, collect wallet addresses to send cNFTs to, view cNFTs, and send NFTs. It also provides an interface to draft cNFT messages and view/get notified of cNFTs.
